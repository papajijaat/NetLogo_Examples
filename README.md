The NetLogo environment enables exploration of emergent phenomena. It comes with an extensive models library including models in a variety of domains, such as economics, biology, physics, chemistry, psychology, system dynamics.

I started to experiment with NetLogo while doing my Modeling and Simulation course during 3rd Semester.
